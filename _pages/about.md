Here is Zhenyu Wang, the fifth year PhD from the School of ECEE, Arizona State University. My research interest includes VLSI Circuit and ASIC Design for AI Accelerators, Hardware and Software Co-design for AI accelerations, Deep Learning Algorithm Optimization and Compression, Performance Modeling and System-level Benchmarking for 2.5D/3D Chiplet-based Heterogeneous Integration with AI (DNNs) models, AI Acceleration Architecture.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof.Yu(Kevin) Cao (https://cse.umn.edu/ece/yu-kevin-cao) of Microelectronics of Co-design Research Group
